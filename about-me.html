      <p>I'm an English and Legal Studies major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. On campus, I work as an assistant manager at my University's IT Computer Classroom department where I assist students and staff with technical questions and oversee the smooth operation of one IT Computer Classroom. I am also a writing tutor for the University's Writing Center. At the Writing Center, I work with students in all disciplines on a variety of writing projects. </p>
      <p>Both of these experiences have provided me with experience communicating information to individuals in a clear and concise way. I hope to further this by pursuing a career in technical writing after graduation. To prepare for this field, I am  working towards a certificate in Professional Writing and Technical Communication. Beyond technical writing, I am open to careers that allow me to utilize my writing skills - whatever that may be.</p>
